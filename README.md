# ChangeDetection_Tracking
This assignment is submitted through github, because aulaweb didn't allow to upload large files.
Github also has this limitation, but there is way to upload files in several instances just the way it was done in this repository.

Before running the script, it is required to unzip all "seq2 part #" files to the same folder "videosurveillance" (one should be created manually), as well as Sequence 1 folder.

Lab_tracking_computer_vision.pdf is the report file written in latex format.
Refer to it for the explanation of code etc.

Submission is done by Ayan Mazhitov and Madi Nurmanov.
